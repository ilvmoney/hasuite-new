I, DeathRight have started a new development on HaSuite because I was bored and wanted to see it finished, and the first thing I'm gonna fix is HaCreator's save function. So far, I have fixed the Map Simulator and had the changes made in the Map Info editor save._


### All credit goes to haha01haha01 and the original team for making these awesome programs, and getting HaCreator v2 to where it was! ###
